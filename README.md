## the Perl module

Comments are marked as Markdown-style.

It still has a lot of bugs, but at least it works.

The module can be run as:

    perl commentdown.pl your-package-directory

An example of the comment of a function is:

    # == title
    # title of the function
    #
    # == param
    # -x a value returned by `function`
    # -y a value returned by `package::function2`. If ``x`` is a list, then ...
    #
    # == details
    # first line, blablabla...
    #
    # - item1...
    # - item2...
    #
    # -item1 named item1...
    # -item2 named itme2...
    #
    f = function(x, y) {
    }

would be converted to 

    \name{f}
    \alias{f}
    \title{
      title of the function
    }
    \description{
      title of the function
    }
    \usage{
    f(x, y)
    }
    \arguments{
      \item{x}{a value returned by \code{\link{function}}}
      \item{y}{a value returned by \code{\link[package]{function2}}. If \code{x} is a list, then ...}
    }
    \details{
      first line, blablabla...
      \itemize{
        \item item1...
        \item item2...
      }
      \describe{
        \item{item1}{named item1...}
        \item{item2}{named itme2...}
      }
    }
